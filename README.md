![42 Network Cover](imgs/1337.jpeg)

This repository contains a collection of programming projects that I completed as part of my computer science studies at the 1337 (Mohammed VI Polytechnic University).

## Contents
The projects cover a wide range of programming concepts, including:
- Workflow and Functions
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- File I/O
- Processes
- Object-Oriented Programming
- APIs
- GUI Development

Some projects are individual, while others are group projects.

## Requirements
Each project has its own set of requirements, which are specified in the project's README file.

## Usage
These projects are primarily written in C/C++. Please note that they were developed in a macOS environment and may not work properly in other operating systems, such as Linux and Windows. To run a project, navigate to its directory and refer to the project's README file for instructions on how to start the project.
