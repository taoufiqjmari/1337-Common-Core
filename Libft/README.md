2 - On Terminal, go to project directory
	$> cd Libft

3 - Make the executable
	$> make
	$> make bonus (to use linked list functions)

4 - Make a main.c file having a main function that uses one or mix of the functions in the library (don't forget to include the header file of the function in the main.c)
	#include "libft.h"

5 - Compile the main.c and libft.a
	$> gcc main.c libft.a -o program

6 - Run
	$> ./program
```
```
The project follows the school norm:
